# Image To Co-occurrence Probability
These codes are written in C++ and have been verified to work with OpenCV 3.4.3.

Calculates the probability of co-occurrence from gray-scale images.
The obtained co-occurrence probability can be plotted as a 2D image or a 3D histogram.

## Demo

## Requirement
* c++17
* OpenCV 3.4.3
* Python 3.8.10
* matplotlib 3.4.2

## Note
I have only tested in the following environment:
* Ubuntu 20.04
* c++17
* OpenCV 3.4.3
* Python 3.8.10
* matplotlib 3.4.2
 
# Usage
 
Please create python code named "demo.py".
And copy &amp; paste [Day4 tutorial code](https://cpp-learning.com/pyxel_physical_sim4/).
 
Run "demo.py"
 
```bash
python demo.py
```
