# Image co-occurrence probability

![image](image/image.png)

A co-occurrence histogram is the frequency of occurrence of a pair of pixel values _p_ and _q_ for each of two pixels _P_ and _Q_ in an image, over the entire image. 
A co-occurrence histogram can be created by arranging the pixel values _P_ and _Q_ in a two-dimensional matrix.

Normalizing the co-occurrence histogram by the frequency of occurrence results in the co-occurrence probability.
